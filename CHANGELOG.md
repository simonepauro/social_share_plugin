## 0.2.0

* **Breaking change:** migrate from the deprecated original Android Support Library to AndroidX. This shouldn't result in any functional changes, but it requires any Android apps using this plugin to [also migrate](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/androidx-compatibility) if they're using the original support library.

## 0.0.1

* Initial release.
